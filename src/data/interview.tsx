		question: "Can you introduce yourself?",
		answer: "\
			I’m Aurélien. I’m 21 years old. I was born in Mountain View, CA, USA. I then moved to Paris, France for all of my studies up to my engineering degree in computer science. I will be graduating from Efrei Paris next March (2023).\

	},
	{
		question: "How did you get into the tech world?",
		answer: "\
			I’ve always been profoundly curious about how things work, especially the apps that I used on my computer as a child.<br/>\
			Since I was already immersed in IT culture at home, I had all the tools needed to start exploring available at a young age. So, I jumped in and never left.\
		"
	},
	{
		question: "How long have you been working in tech?",
		answer: "\
			My first steps in computer science happened in 2011, when I was trying to grasp concepts by reading documentation and just experimenting.<br/>\
			I would say I only became a <i>web developer</i> a year later in 2012, and a <i>Java</i> developer in 2013. I earned my first buck by selling my services and software around that time. I then created a video games organization with a friend.<br/>\
			In 2016, I began working with bigger corporations on more complex business-grade projects. I founded my own company in 2019, at 18 years old.\

	{
		question: "What did you study in college? How did you acquire your knowledge?",
		answer: "\
			I joined Efrei Paris, engineering school of digital technologies, in 2019. It has consistently been <a href=\"https://eng.efrei.fr/the-school/rankings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external\">ranked in the top computer science schools in France</a>.<br/>\
			I majored in <i>DevOps/Cloud Architecture</i>, minoring as <i>Certified Ethical Hacker</i>.<br/>\
			Most of my knowledge and experience is self-taught though. I learn best through experimentation in real scenarios, and by reading documentation.\

	{
		question: "What are 3 of your most prominent qualities?",
		answer: "\
			<i>1.</i> I pay very high <i>attention to detail</i>. Trailing whitespace? None. Spacing? To the pixel. Algorithms? Optimized. Edge cases? Covered. <sub>Hotel? Trivago.</sub><br/>\
			<i>2.</i> I’m an extremely <i>fast-learner</i>: I learn new tools in a day, and achieve a comprehensive understanding within a month. It led to me being very flexible, as I have worked in plenty of different environments and can adapt instantly.<br/>\
			<i>3.</i> I’m <i>honest</i> about my work and in the feedback that I give. I can give constructive criticism about others’ work, and mine too. I own my mistakes.\
		"
	},
	{
		question: "What are your 3 biggest weaknesses?",
		answer: "\
			<i>1.</i> I’m fairly <i>uncomprising</i> in my decisions and personal interactions. I do not praise easily. And, I struggle settling for suboptimal solutions to save time.<br/>\
			<i>2.</i> I am rather <i>taciturn</i>. I am more productive and only reach flow state alone. I usually prefer exploring solutions by myself rather than being dependent.<br/>\
			<i>3.</i> I have a hard time working in <i>unchanging contexts</i>. I need to acquire new skills and discover new situations and disciplines constantly to keep interest.\

	{
		question: "What are you passionate about?",
		answer: "\
			First of all, high tech, obviously. I’ve spent most of my spare time working on either computer software or hardware for the past 10+ years.<br/>\
			I also like playing video games and driving cars. I love reading about space, aircrafts, and more generally innovation in science.<br/>\
			Finally, I’m committed to the environment, and have been for over 6 years.\
		"
	},
	{
		question: "What are your mid-term career objectives?",
		answer: "\
			I aim at working for a multinational tech corporation soon, where I can evolve and discover new career paths. Additionally, I’m thrilled by solving challenging issues at a global scale and being impactful in IT. I strongly believe I can be an asset for doing so through innovation and consolidation.<br/>\
			I would also like to travel around the world while working remotely sometimes. Even if that means having to attend meetings in the middle of the night.\
